                <p>We believe water is the best investment the world can make to improve health, 
                <br> empower women, enable access to education, increase family income and change 
                lives. Yet, <strong>785 million people</strong> lack access to safe water.</p>

                For millions around the world, access to funds stands between them and safe water and sanitation in their home. 
                <br>We offer a portfolio of smart solutions that break down the financial barriers between people living in poverty and access to safe water and sanitation.
                Our unique solutions are market-driven and adapt to the 11 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America where we work.
                <br> With 30 years of experience and insight, and in collaboration with our partners, we are developing more efficient,
                <br> scalable solutions and using financing as a tool to help people living in poverty get access to safe water and sanitation.

                <br>We use access to affordable financing to bring safe water and sanitation to the world, and it is working. Through years of experience,
                we found that millions of people were paying high prices for water from vendors or collecting water from unsafe natural sources. 
                Both options cost families in time, money, opportunities and health.
                For millions of people, financing makes sense. Small, affordable loans offer families the ability to 
                purchase long-term safe water and sanitation solutions that solve their immediate need and over time will cost less than continuing to pay for temporary fixes.
                Water.org believes that access to capital is the most important barrier to overcome in order to solve the global water crisis. 
                We have broadened our efforts and joined forces with others to increase financing for water and sanitation, helping even more people in need.

                <strong>Our Solution: Financing</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>WaterCredit is our core solution. We work with our in-country financial partners to add loans for water and sanitation
                solutions to their portfolios. These partners then mobilize funding from capital markets to provide affordable loans to people in need
                of water. People living in poverty use these loans to put a tap or toilet in their homes. Every repaid loan creates the opportunity
                or another family to get the safe water and toilets they need, fast and affordably. It is a pay-it-forward system that
                makes it possible to help more people in ways that will last.

                <strong>Our solutions increase the impact of your dollar</strong>
                <p> Based on the capital we've helped mobilize and our expenses to date, every dollar donated to Water.org helps unlock $15 
                for water and sanitation solutions for people living in poverty. This is possible because we use philanthropic funds to set-up
                market-driven financial solutions that bring safe water and sanitation to people in need. Our work to help the world reach
                a critical goal - safe water and sanitation for all - drives our desire to make a dollar go as far as possible. Our donors
                recognize that giving to Water.org is a smart investment. And our local partners know that working with us is a smart business
                decision. Together, we can change more lives, faster and more efficiently.
